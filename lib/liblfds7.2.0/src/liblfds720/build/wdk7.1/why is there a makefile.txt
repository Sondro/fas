The WDK 7.1 build system is based around the command line tool "build",
provided by MS.  This uses a couple of files, such as sources and dirs,
but it does not use a makefile.

The makefile is here simply to operate "build" indirectly, via gnumake,
so that the WDK 7.1 build can be operated much more easily by the
top-level makefile which builds all the libraries and binaries.
